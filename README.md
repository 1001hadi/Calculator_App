This calculator app is my 4th project in a software development mastermind program and it was the most challengeable one so far.
I use HTML,CSS and JavaScript languages to code and beld this application.

When I started this project I knew it would be the most difficult project I'm going to beld, but these challenges helped me understand how the logic works better and improved my debugging skills.
